    "# IEEE Floating Point Arithmetic\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Reference: [Overton](https://cs.nyu.edu/~overton/book/) Chapter 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lecture, we introduce the\n",
    "[IEEE Standard for Floating-Point Arithmetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_754).\n",
    "There are many  possible ways of representing real numbers on a computer, as well as \n",
    "the precise behaviour of operations such as addition, multiplication, etc.\n",
    "Before the 1980s each processor had potentially a different representation for \n",
    "real numbers, as well as different behaviour for operations.  \n",
    "IEEE introduced in 1985 was a means to standardise this across\n",
    "processors so that algorithms would produce consistent and reliable results.\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter may seem very low level for a mathematics course but there are\n",
    "two important reasons to understand the behaviour of floating point numbers:\n",
    "1. Floating point arithmetic is very precisely defined, and can even be used\n",
    "in rigorous computations as we shall see in the problem sheets.\n",
    "2. Failure to understand floating point arithmetic can cause many errors\n",
    "in practice, with the extreme example being the [explosion of the Ariane 5 rocket](https://youtu.be/N6PWATvLQCY?t=86).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we begin, we load two external packages. SetRounding.jl allows us \n",
    "to set the rounding mode of floating point arithmetic. ColorBitstring.jl\n",
    "  implements a function `printbits`\n",
    "which print the bits of floating point numbers in colour. \n",
    "Each colour corresponds to a different part of the representation:\n",
    "the <span style=\"color:red\">sign bit</span>, the <span style=\"color:green\">exponent bits</span>, \n",
    "and the <span style=\"color:blue\">significand bits</span> which we shall learn about shortly."

    "## 1.  Binary representation of real numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "Before discussing how to represent real numbers with a finite number\n",
    "of bits, we consider what one could do with an infinite number of bits,\n",
    "that is, binary expansions.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use the notation:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "(b_0.b_1b_2b_3\\ldots)_2 = b_0 + {b_1 \\over 2} + {b_2 \\over 2^2} + {b_3 \\over 2^3} + \\cdots\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $b_k$ are either 0 or 1. Every number $0 \\leq x < 1$ has a binary representation in this form.\n",
    "First we show some examples of verifying a numbers binary representation:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**\n",
    "Consider the number `1/3`.  In decimal we all know:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "1/3 = 0.3333\\ldots =  \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty {3 \\over 10^k}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "We will see that in binary\n",
    "$$\n",
    "1/3 = (0.010101\\ldots)_2 = \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty {1 \\over 2^{2k}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Both results can be proven using the geometric series:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\sum_{k=0}^\\infty z^k = {1 \\over 1 - z}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "provided $|z| < 1$. That is, with $z = 1/10$ we see the decimal case:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "3\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty {1 \\over 10^k} = {3 \\over 1 - {1 \\over 10}} - 3 = {1 \\over 3}\n",

    "A similar argument works for binary with $z = {1 \\over 4}$:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty {1 \\over 4^k} = {1 \\over 1 - 1/4} - 1 = {1 \\over 3}\n",
    "$$\n",
