    "[IEEE Standard for Floating-Point Arithmetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_754).\n",
    "There are many  possible ways of representing real numbers on a computer, as well as \n",
    "the precise behaviour of operations such as addition, multiplication, etc.\n",
    "Before the 1980s each processor had potentially a different representation for \n",
    "real numbers, as well as different behaviour for operations.  \n",
    "IEEE introduced in 1985 was a means to standardise this across\n",
    "processors so that algorithms would produce consistent and reliable results.\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter may seem very low level for a mathematics course but there are\n",
    "two important reasons to understand the behaviour of floating point numbers:\n",
    "1. Floating point arithematic is very precisely defined, and can even be used\n",
    "in rigorous computations as we shall see in the problem sheets.\n",
    "2. Failure to understand floating point arithmetic can cause many errors\n",
    "in practice, with the extreme example being the [explosion of the Ariane 5 rocket](https://youtu.be/N6PWATvLQCY?t=86).\n",

    "\n",
    "Before we begin, we load two external packages. SetRounding.jl allows us \n",

    "  implements a function `printbits`\n",
    "which print the bits of floating point numbers in colour. \n",
    "Each colour corresponds to a different part of the representation:\n",
    "the <span style=\"color:red\">sign bit</span>, the <span style=\"color:green\">exponent bits</span>, \n",

    "and more data can be fit into a GPU's limitted memory.\n",
    "3.  `Float16` is a type representing real numbers using 316 bits.\n",
